# FinBERT-ABSA
NLP model for the analysis of financial news - Extraction of ESG scores for companies mentioned in the news.

# Abstract 

This paper presents a project aimed at extracting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores for companies mentioned in financial news, providing a decision support tool for fund managers. The approach involves manual annotation of a financial news dataset comprising approximately 2000 training samples. The FinBERT model is employed and fine-tuned for the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task, focusing on isolating scores related to a specific aspect in each sentence, namely, the mentioned company. The methodology showcases the adaptation of pre-trained language models for targeted ESG assessment in the financial domain, contributing to the advancement of sentiment analysis applications in the context of investment decision-making.
